            The project "DESTINATION" is about finding the best course in one of best institutes of the country where you can get an admission in.This would also help creating the network between the students all over the country from the small institute to some of the most recognised and famous institutes of the country.This platform would help students in finding answers for the queries in any regard.I hope this would also help in sharing ideas and also making a oppurtunity to meet all the students all over the country who work on some science or piece of work.Hope this platform help you.
